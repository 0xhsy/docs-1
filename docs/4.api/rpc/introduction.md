Welcome! If you want to interact directly with the NEAR RPC API you have come to the right place. The NEAR RPC API is the
interface used to talk with the NEAR network. For example, tools such as the [NEAR API JS](../../3.tools/near-api-js/cookbook.md)
are actually just an abstractions to simplify making RPC calls.
