# Overview

#### NEAR Protocol is a scalable, developer-friendly platform for creating decentralized applications.

Before we begin, it will be helpful to have a general understanding of:

* [Smart Contract Basics](prerequisites/the_basics.md)
* [Typescript](prerequisites/language-typescript.md)

### [Quick Start](working-smart-contracts/)

The quickest way to get started with NEAR is by coding in NEAR studio, our fully hosted IDE. Take a look at our [Near Studio walkthrough](quick-start/near-studio-ide-intro.md).

From here, it'll be helpful to get comfortable with:

* [Writing Contracts on NEAR](working-smart-contracts/writing-contracts.md)
* [Calling Contracts on NEAR](working-smart-contracts/calling-contracts.md)

If you want to build locally, take a look at:

* [Installation guide](quick-start/installation.md)
* [Local development guide](quick-start/developing-locally.md)

### [Tutorials](tutorials/)

The [Tutorials](tutorials/) section contains several tutorials which will help you learn how to build, test and deploy smart contracts.

We recommend you start with the Zero to Hero tutorial which will show you how to save complex data structures to the blockchain, and bridge on-chain and off-chain services.

* A [Zero to Hero](tutorials/zero-to-hero.md) Oracle tutorial
* A simple [multiplayer interactive game](tutorials/multiplayergame.md)
* Create your own [ERC-20 token smart contract](tutorials/token.md)

### Client API

The Client API section contains [documentation for the NEARLib.js](https://github.com/pndpo/docs/tree/105a69144f3b2860f28aa416ddfb14bf57cc0ef7/lib/js/README.md) library.
