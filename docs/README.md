# Overview

#### NEAR Protocol is a scalable, developer-friendly platform for creating decentralized applications.

If you're just starting to develop applications on the blockchain, our [Smart Contract basics](the_basics.md) section will provide you with a cheat sheet to hit the ground running.

It will also be helpful to have a general understanding of [Typescript](details/language-typescript.md), which is what Near Smart Contracts are written in. 

### [Quick Start](quick-start/)

The quickest way to get started with NEAR is by coding in NEAR studio, our fully hosted IDE. Take a look at our [Near Studio walkthrough](quick-start/near-studio-ide-intro.md). 

From here, it'll be helpful to get comfortable with: 

* Writing Contracts on NEAR
* Calling Contracts on NEAR

### [Developing Locally](developing-locally/)

Want to code on Near locally? Take a look at our: 

* [Installation guide](developing-locally/installation.md)
* [Local development guide](developing-locally/medium.md)

### [Tutorials](tutorials/)

The [Tutorials](tutorials/) section contains several tutorials which will help you learn how to build, test and deploy smart contracts.

* A simple [multiplayer interactive game](tutorials/multiplayergame.md)
* Create your own [ERC-20 token smart contract](tutorials/token.md)
* How to build an [Oracle](tutorials/oracle.md)
* Run your own [TestNet: locally or on Google Cloud](tutorials/run-your-own-testnet.md)

### [Technical Details](details/)

The [Technical Details](details/) section contains in-depth information about the protocol itself.

### Client API

The Client API section contains [documentation for the NEARLib.js](https://github.com/pndpo/docs/tree/105a69144f3b2860f28aa416ddfb14bf57cc0ef7/lib/js/README.md) library.
