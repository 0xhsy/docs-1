# Quick start

There are several options for quick start, depending on what you are trying to do:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Easy**](easy.md)**:** Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE
2. \*\*\*\*[**Intermediate**](medium.md)**:** Use NEAR with an existing front-end
3. \*\*\*\*[**Advanced**](advanced.md)**:** Build and run a local DevNet node
4. \*\*\*\*[**Expert**](expert.md)**:** Build and run a local multi-node AlphaNet

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local DevNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted DevNet:** NEAR hosts a single-node DevNet in the cloud. This is currently the default pointed to by our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet.
3. **Hosted AlphaNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node AlphaNet in the cloud.

_Blocks on the DevNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
