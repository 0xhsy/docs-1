# Quick start

There are several options for quick start, depending on what you are trying to do:

1. [**Beginner**](easy.md)**:** Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE
2. [**Intermediate**](medium.md)**:** Use NEAR with an existing front-end
3. [**Advanced**](advanced.md)**:** Build and run a local TestNet node
4. [**Expert**]()**:** Build and run a local multi-node TestNet

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local TestNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted TestNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node TestNet in the cloud. This is currently the default that our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet point to.

_Blocks on the TestNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
