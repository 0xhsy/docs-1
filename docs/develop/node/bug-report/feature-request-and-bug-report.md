## Feature Request and Bug Report {#feature-request-and-bug-report}

The NEAR team is actively solicitating feedback from the Node and Validator Community, and offers a process for the community to engage in feature / enhancement requests and to submit bug reports. Besides the existing NEAR Validator channels, the NEAR team is introducing a formal process for feature requests and bug reports.

With respect to the experience of operating a NEAR node, all bugs and feature enhancements are publicly tracked in the Github project tracker [`Node Experience`](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/31). Node operators are welcome to create new issues for features and bugs, and to add these issues into the [Github project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/42).
