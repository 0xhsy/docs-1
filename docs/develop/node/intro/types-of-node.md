You can run three different types of node - Validator Node, RPC Node, and Archival Node.

## Validator Node
Validator Nodes are the operators of the NEAR blockchain and are essential to the health of the network. Validator nodes participate in the consensus and produce blocks and/or chunks"

## RPC Node
RPC Nodes are RPC service providers for that provide public RPC endpoints for developers to use. The NEAR Foundation currently maintains a public RPC endpoint `http://rpc.mainnet.near.org/` that is free for everyone to use. However, any participants are encouraged to run their own RPC node and offer RPC services through a grant from the NEAR Foundation. For more information, please reach out in Validator channels on Telegram or Discord.

## Archival Node
Archival Nodes store full blockchain data, and build an archive of historical states. These nodes are useful for block explorers, chain analytics, and infrastructure providers.
