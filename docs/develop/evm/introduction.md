[Project Aurora](https://aurora.dev/) delivers an Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM) on the NEAR protocol. It is comprised of the following components:

| Name                                                                                    | Description                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------- |
| **[Aurora Engine](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-engine)**                    | Implements an EVM on the NEAR protocol |
| **[Aurora CLI](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-cli)**                          | Command-Line Interface (CLI) for the Aurora Engine |
| **[Aurora Engine Client for JS](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora.js)**          | JavaScript Client for the Aurora Engine |
| **[Aurora Relayer](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-relayer)** | A JSON-RPC server compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API
| **[NEAR Protocol Web3 provider](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/near-web3-provider)** | Web3 Provider to connect Ethereum Frontend or Truffle to NEAR Protocol

The following sections describe how to use the EVM on the NEAR protocol with
existing Ethereum tooling while requiring minimal code changes.
