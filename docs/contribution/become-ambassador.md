#### You cannot get Near out of your head? - Then you are at the right place!
#### Become an Ambassador and contribute consitantly to our project!

## What you will be doing?

#### The devs here can:
* Build dApps and connect with dApp developers
* Make tutorials and share your learning
* Answer developer questions in Discord, Github etc
* Run developer meetups
* Run validator meetups

#### Not a developer? - No problem!
* Run meetups around open web and use cases
* Write blog posts about use cases, web3, and business models
* Translate content
* Review dApps & provide user feedback
* Beta-test dApps
* Manage online communities on e.g. Discord, Telegram
* Gather community feedback to contribute to governance processes

Join a global network of ambassadors in key regions working together to grow the NEAR ecosystem.

## Who is our community?
The NEAR community IS NOT a community of crypto traders and investors. We are a community of builders and makers, and our ambassador network reflects that.

#### The Dos:
* Run meetups for developers, dApp projects and validators
* Facilitate discussions around Web3 use cases, implementations and sustainable business models
* Attract and educate community members who want to get their hands dirty and build sustainable projects

#### The Don'ts:
* Run hodler meetups
* Manage online communities for crypto traders and price pumping
* Attract community members who are only interested in crypto for investment purposes

## We value your input! Here are the benefits:

#### Build the Future Web
We believe the web needs to change. We are fighting for an open, equitable web, when people are in control of their data. As an ambassador, you will take part in building the future of Web3.

#### Build Relationships
As an ambassador, you will build relationships with the core Near team, as well as other ambassadors around the world via ambassador-only online channels and virtual meetups.

#### Get Compensated
You will receive compensation with 1000 NEAR tokens per month that you are part of the program for completing specific ambassador tasks (running meetups, voting, promoting content on NEAR).

#### Compete for Prizes
In addition, you will have the chance to compete for a prize pool of additional NEAR tokens that grows based on the number of NEAR ambassadors. The competition will be different every month, giving you lots of different chances to win.
