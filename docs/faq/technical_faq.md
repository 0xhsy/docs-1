## Comparisons to Other Technologies

### How does NEAR's design compare to Polkadot?
*Last updated: 20200103*

The main difference is that in Polkadot every application needs to have its own blockchain (which is pretty hard to launch) and there are only 32 slots (up to 100 later). Whereas in NEAR it's straightforward to launch an app (you can try it on testnet now - https://near.dev/) and there is no limit on how many apps. Additionally, there are a bunch of consensus, security, staking, economics, smart contracting differences on top of it but they won't fit here.

The other major difference is our focus on user and developer experience - we are really trying to make it easy for non-crypto ppl to build stuff. We measure ourselves based on how easy it is to start using apps on NEAR by folks who never owned crypto for example.
