### Why doesn’t NEAR just do a side chain of Ethereum?
*Last Updated: 20200103*

It doesn’t make sense from a technology perspective or a usability perspective. Consider the case of Scale labs which is doing a sharded POS sidechain and that solves exactly the problem (scale) that no one actually has.

We have a very different account model, consensus model and state transition. These all are vast improvements over Ethereum and wouldn’t play nice as a side chain.


### Why doesn’t NEAR just work with the Ethereum Foundation on Ethereum?
*Last Updated: 20200103*

Ethereum has done fantastic things to introduce the world to a virtual machine run atop a blockchain.  We get asked a lot why we don’t just join forces with Ethereum. Both organizations are producing decentralized platforms that accomplish essentially the same goals. Fundamentally, though we believe that we can both:

- Build better tech
- Ship it faster

Regarding the former, we have a scaling (sharding) solution that matches or exceeds the existing Ethereum specs but, more importantly, we have reimagined everything from the contract level through the transaction fees and economics to focus on providing both developers and their end-users with an incredibly good experience. This focus on usability is uniquely in our DNA and it is not part of the Ethereum 2.0 spec.

Regarding the latter, our team is the best in the world and we have deep experience both launching businesses and engineering sharded systems at scale.  The last several decades have shown via a Darwinian process what approaches work and which ones do not when building effective and future-proof developer platforms. While the Ethereum organization brought revolutionary technology to market, their approach to ongoing iteration suffers from significant inefficiencies that our processes cut out.  We expect to get to market with the NEAR platform well ahead of what Ethereum will do, particularly given the baggage of the existing Ethereum design and state.

So, basically, we can give the world better technology faster by operating independently.
