# Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is by using [NEAR studio](near-studio-ide.md), our fully hosted IDE environment.

From there, read over how to work with our Smart Contracts, or take a look at a Tutorial.

If you're interested in working locally, take a look at our installation guide, and then develop an application locally.
