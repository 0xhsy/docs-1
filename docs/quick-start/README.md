# Quick Start

Before we begin, it will be helpful to have a general understanding of: 

* [Smart Contract Basics](../the_basics.md)
* [Typescript](../details/language-typescript.md)

### NEAR Studio IDE

The quickest way to get started is by using [NEAR studio](near-studio-ide-intro.md), our fully hosted IDE environment. Take a look at our [Near Studio Walkthrough](near-studio-ide-intro.md).

### NEAR Programming Basics

* Writing Contracts on Near
* Calling Contracts on Near

### Local Development

* [Installation Guide](../developing-locally/installation.md)
* Developing on Near locally

### Development Environments

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local DevNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted DevNet:** NEAR hosts a single-node DevNet in the cloud. This is currently the default pointed to by our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet.
3. **Hosted AlphaNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node AlphaNet in the cloud.

_Blocks on the DevNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
