# Smart Contracts on Near

### NEAR Smart Contract Basics

* [Writing Contracts](writing-contracts.md)
* [Calling Contracts](calling-contracts.md)

The quickest way to get started is by using [NEAR studio](../quick-start-1/near-studio-ide-intro.md), our fully hosted IDE environment. Take a look at our [Near Studio Walkthrough](../quick-start-1/near-studio-ide-intro.md).

If you're interested in doing a simple tutorial to learn how to build run and deploy, take a look at our Hello World tutorial. 

### Development Environments

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local DevNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted DevNet:** NEAR hosts a single-node DevNet in the cloud. This is currently the default pointed to by our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet.
3. **Hosted AlphaNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node AlphaNet in the cloud.

_Blocks on the DevNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
