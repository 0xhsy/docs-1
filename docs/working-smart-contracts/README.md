# Working with Smart Contracts

### NEAR Smart Contract Basics

Take a look at these docs to get started with writing your first smart contract.

### Development Environments

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local TestNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted TestNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node TestNet in the cloud. This is currently the default that our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet point to.

_Blocks on the TestNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
