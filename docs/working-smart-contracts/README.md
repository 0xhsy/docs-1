### Development Environments

We have 3 development environments currently available:

1. **Local DevNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
2. **Hosted DevNet:** NEAR hosts a single-node DevNet in the cloud. This is currently the default pointed to by our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet.
3. **Hosted AlphaNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node AlphaNet in the cloud.

_Blocks on the DevNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed \(so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes\)._
