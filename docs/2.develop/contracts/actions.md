Smart contracts can perform a variety of `Actions` on the network such as transferring NEARs, or
calling method in other contracts.

An important property of `Actions` is that they can be batched together when they act over the same contract.
**Batched actions** have the advantage that they act as a unit: they are executed in the same [receipt](../../1.concepts/1.basics/transactions/overview.md#receipt-receipt), and if
**any of them fail**, then they **all get reverted**.

:::info
Once more, `Actions` can be batched only when they act on the same contract. This means that you can batch
calling two methods on the same contract, but **not** calling two methods on different contracts.

## Transfer NEARs ‚ìÉ

You can send NEAR tokens from the Balance of your contract. If the method in which you
invoke the transfer finishes correctly, then you can safely assume that the transfers
will **always succeed**.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, AccountId, Promise, Balance};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn transfer(&self, to: AccountId, amount: Balance){
      Promise::new(to).transfer(amount);
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
You do **NOT** need to make a callback method to check if the transfer succeeded. It will always
succeed, except in the extremely unlikely case that the receiver is deleted right after the transfer
is queue.
:::

:::caution
Remember that your balance is used to cover for the contract's storage. When sending money, make sure
you always leave enough to cover for future storage needs.

## Create a New Account

Your contract can create sub accounts of itself, i.e. `<prefix>.<account-id>.near`.
Something important to remark is that an account does **NOT** have control over
its sub-accounts, since they have their own keys. Indeed, sub-accounts work as
completely separated accounts, but they are useful for organizing your accounts
(e.g. `dao.project.near`, `token.project.near`).


<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env, Promise, Balance};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }
                            
  const MIN_STORAGE: Balance = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000; //0.001‚ìÉ

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn create(&self, prefix: String){
      let account_id = prefix + "." + &env::current_account_id().to_string();
      Promise::new(account_id.parse().unwrap())
      .create_account()
      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE);
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
  Notice that in the snippet we are transferring some money to the new account for storage
:::

:::caution
  When you create an account by default it has no keys, meaning it cannot sign transactions.
  See the following section [adding keys](#add-keys) for more information.

## Deploy a Contract

If you just created an account using the previous action, then you can deploy a contract on it.
For this, you will need to pre-load the byte-code you want to deploy in your contract.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env, Promise, Balance};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }

  const MIN_STORAGE: Balance = 1_100_000_000_000_000_000_000_000; //1.1‚ìÉ
  const HELLO_CODE: &[u8] = include_bytes!("./hello.wasm");

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn create_hello(&self, prefix: String){
      let account_id = prefix + "." + &env::current_account_id().to_string();
      Promise::new(account_id.parse().unwrap())
      .create_account()
      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE)
      .deploy_contract(HELLO_CODE.to_vec());
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Add Keys

When you use actions to create a new account, the created account does not have keys, meaning that it
**cannot sign transactions** (e.g. to update its contract, delete itself, transfer money). However, their
code **can** still call other contracts and transfer money as part of a **cross-contract call** (since
another person is the `signer`), but that's it.

To enable using the account for something else than a smart contract, you need to add keys to it. You have
two options:
1. `add_access_key`: adds keys that only allow to call specific methods in a specific account.
2. `add_full_access_key`: adds keys that give full access to the account.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env, Promise, Balance, PublicKey};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }

  const MIN_STORAGE: Balance = 1_100_000_000_000_000_000_000_000; //1.1‚ìÉ
  const HELLO_CODE: &[u8] = include_bytes!("./hello.wasm");

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn create_hello(&self, prefix: String, public_key: PublicKey){
      let account_id = prefix + "." + &env::current_account_id().to_string();
      Promise::new(account_id.parse().unwrap())
      .create_account()
      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE)
      .deploy_contract(HELLO_CODE.to_vec())
      .add_full_access_key(public_key);
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Notice that what you actually add is a "public key". Whoever holds its private counterpart,
i.e. the private-key, will be able to fully use the newly created account (or use it only to
call specific methods in another contract if `add_access_key` is used).

---

## Function Call

Your smart contract can call methods in another contract. In the snippet bellow we call a method
in a deployed [Hello NEAR](../quickstart/hello-near.md) contract, and check if everything went
right in the callback.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env, log, Promise, Gas, PromiseError};
  use serde_json::json;

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }

  const HELLO_NEAR: &str = "hello-nearverse.testnet";
  const NO_DEPOSIT: u128 = 0;
  const CALL_GAS: Gas = Gas(5_000_000_000_000);

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn call_method(&self){
      let args = json!({ "message": "howdy".to_string() })
                .to_string().into_bytes().to_vec();

      Promise::new(HELLO_NEAR.parse().unwrap())
      .function_call("set_greeting".to_string(), args, NO_DEPOSIT, CALL_GAS)
      .then(
        Promise::new(env::current_account_id())
        .function_call("callback".to_string(), Vec::new(), NO_DEPOSIT, CALL_GAS)
      );
    }

    pub fn callback(&self, #[callback_result] result: Result<(), PromiseError>){
      if result.is_err(){
          log!("Something went wrong")
      }else{
          log!("Message changed")
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
The snippet showed above is a low level way of calling other methods. We recommend make calls to other contracts as explained in the [Cross-contract Calls section](crosscontract.md).

## Delete Account

There are two scenarios in which you can use the `delete_account` action:
1. As the **last** action in a chain of actions.
2. To make your smart contract delete its own account.

<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ü¶Ä - Rust">

  ```rust
  use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
  use near_sdk::{near_bindgen, env, Promise, Balance, AccountId};

  #[near_bindgen]
  #[derive(Default, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)]
  pub struct Contract { }
                            
  const MIN_STORAGE: Balance = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000; //0.001‚ìÉ

  #[near_bindgen]
  impl Contract {
    pub fn create_delete(&self, prefix: String, beneficiary: AccountId){
      let account_id = prefix + "." + &env::current_account_id().to_string();
      Promise::new(account_id.parse().unwrap())
      .create_account()
      .transfer(MIN_STORAGE)
      .delete_account(beneficiary);
    }

    pub fn self_delete(beneficiary: AccountId){
      Promise::new(env::current_account_id())
      .delete_account(beneficiary);
    }
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Token Loss
If the beneficiary account does not exist, a refund receipt will be generated and sent
back to the original account. But since the original account has already been deleted
an error will rise, and **the funds will be dispersed among validators**.
