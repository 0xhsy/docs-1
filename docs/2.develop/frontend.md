This section has not been implemented yet, but it will contain a high level explanation on how to use near-api-js to make a frontend. We leave the more complex things for the (not written yet) [Integrate](../3.integrate/welcome.md) documentation page or the [near-api-js](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/) website.
