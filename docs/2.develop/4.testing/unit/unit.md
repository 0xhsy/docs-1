While developing your smart contract you will want to test that it works as it is supposed to, and moreover, it does in a safe way.
Unit tests allow you to test the contract methods individually. They are suitable to check if, given a specific input, a method
returns the expected value and changes the state accordingly.

Unit tests are written in the same language as your contract, and are executed localy through [AS-pect](https://tenner-joshua.gitbook.io/as-pect/) in ðŸš€-AS, and natively in ðŸ¦€-RUST.


## Snippet: Testing a Counter
<Tabs className="language-tabs">
  <TabItem value="as" label="ðŸš€ - Assemblyscript">
    <Tabs className="file-tabs">
      <TabItem value="as-main" label="__tests__/main.spec.ts">
        <TestAs></TestAs>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="as-external" label="main.ts">
        <MainAs></MainAs>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rs" label="ðŸ¦€ - Rust">
    <Tabs className="file-tabs">
      <TabItem value="as-external" label="tests/main.ts">
        <ExternalRs></ExternalRs>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="as-main" label="lib.rs">
        <MainRs></MainRs>
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Interacting with the Environment
When testing a method it is usually helpfull to manipulate the [Environment](../../3.contracts/environment/environment.md). In this way, you can test a method using different users (`predecessor`s), attached amounts (`attached_amount`), balances,etc.



In both AS and RUST, the Environment is manipulated throught an object from the SDK (`ðŸš€-VMContext`, `ðŸ¦€-VMContextBuilder`)


## Limitations
While usefull on testing single methods, unit tests are not great for testing [Gas](../../3.contracts/environment/environment.md) and [Storage](../../3.contracts/storage.md) usage or [Transfers](../../3.contracts/actions.md). Furthermore, they are not fully suitable for testing [cross-contract calls](../../3.contracts/crosscontract/crosscontract.md). For these we recommend using integration tests.
