JavaScript is the most popular programming language, used by nearly 14 million developers worldwide. You can write smart-contracts in JavaScript or Typescript, and our SDK will pack them with a lightweight runtime. This can then be compiled into a single Wasm file that can be deployed into the NEAR network.
