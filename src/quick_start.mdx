# Quick start

There are several options for quick start, depending on what you are trying to do:

  1. **Easy:** Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE
  2. **Medium:** Use NEAR with an existing front-end
  3. **Advanced:** Build and run a local DevNet node
  4. **Expert:** Build and run a local multi-node AlphaNet

We have 3 development environments currently available:

  1. **Local DevNet:** You run this node in your local environment.
  2. **Hosted DevNet:** NEAR hosts a single-node DevNet in the cloud. This is currently the default pointed to by our online Studio IDE, Block Explorer and Wallet.
  3. **Hosted AlphaNet:** NEAR hosts a multi-node AlphaNet in the cloud.

*Blocks on the DevNets are not produced continuously -- they are only created when needed (so you can't necessarily rely on them for timing purposes).*

## Easy: Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE

<img src ="https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEARStudio/raw/master/demos/guest_book.gif" width="600px"/>

The easiest way to get started is to skip installing everything on your local machine and just use our fully hosted IDE environment. We have a number of pre-built templates which you can use as starter apps.

To do this:

  1. Go to [NEAR Studio](https://studio.nearprotocol.com) and select the "ToDo MVC" template.
  2. Click "Run" to see the app running!

The app will open in a new window.

*Environment: The smart contract for this is deployed to our hosted single-node DevNet while the front end is deployed to our hosted app.near.ai site.*

**A few notes:**

  + The code that runs on blockchain is in `assembly/main.ts` file.
  + The JavaScript frontend code is in the `src/main.js` file.
  + The UI markup is in `src/main.html file`.

Try changing any of these files. To see your changes, click the "Save" button, and then "Run" button.

**Useful interactions with Studio:**

  + The **"Test"** button will run the JavaScript tests that are described in the `src/test.js` file.
  + The **"Run"** button will deploy your front end (the stuff in the `src/` folder) to our hosted service on `app.near.ai/YOUR_UNIQUE_URL/`.  It's sort of like Github Pages.
    + Share the URL with someone else and they will be able to interact with your application. Make sure to remember the trailing `/`
  + The **"Fork"** button will duplicate the existing code in a new page with a new URL. If you don't want to lose the old URL, copy/paste it somewhere.


## Medium: Use NEAR in an existing app

If you have an app with an existing front-end that you want to hook into the smart contract on the back end, you will need to import our JavaScript SDK on the front-end and write/deploy the smart contract on the back end.

### 1. Import the SDK on your front end

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nearlib@0.2.4/dist/nearlib.js"></script>
```

### 2. Write the smart contract

Write the code!


### 3. Deploy the smart contract


#### Option A: Deploy to your local DevNet

You will need to build and run a local DevNet node. See the following section for how to do this.

Once you have done this, make sure you are within the application's directory and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run-script deploy -- --contract guestbook
```

#### Option B: Deploy to our hosted DevNet

Deploy your contract to the same DevNet which the NEAR Studio IDE deploys to.

## Try the block explorer / debugger

Once you have tested out the NEAR Studio IDE, check out the Block Explorer (aka Debugger).

Navigate to https://studio.nearprotocol.com/debugger/ in your browser to see information on specific blocks and transactions from those blocks.  This is a useful tool when you are trying to debug your contracts.

Another very useful tool is to open up your console's JavaScript console, where you will be able to print logs and errors.



## Advanced: Build & run a local DevNet node

You should be able to do anything you want with the above-mentioned NEAR Studio IDE and the Block Explorer.  If you want to keep digging deeper, try running the local DevNet yourself.

"DevNet" is a single-node "blockchain" that runs WebAssembly and state transition without actually running the full blockchain/consensus functionality.  Essentially, you can interact with it as if it was a multi-node blockchain for the purposes of writing and testing code.

You can run your own DevNet locally by installing and running a node, which will produce blocks. The core NEAR node client is written using the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which uses [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) to manage packages (similar to NPM).


### 1. Setup Rust & dependencies

The most up-to-date procedure for installing and running a node is provided in the [README for the nearcore library on Github](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore).

Follow the steps in that README to get Rust, Cargo and the nearcore library set up.


### 2. Run the node

Once everything is installed, you should be able to run DevNet with:

```bash
cargo run --package=devnet
```

### 3. Deploy your app to DevNet

After you have an app locally developed, you can deploy it to the local DevNet.

### 4 (Optional). Play with your node!

Execute the following in the `nearcore` folder to run some Python scripts which will help you test that your DevNet is working properly:

```bash
# Install pynear
cd pynear
# sudo may be required if you are not testing with a python virtual environment
python setup.py develop

# See usage of rpc helper script
pynear --help

# Get usage of sub command
pynear send_money --help

# Send money
pynear send_money -r bob.near -a 1

# Create a new account for the contract
pynear create_account test_contract 1

# Deploy code for the smart contract account
pynear deploy test_contract tests/hello.wasm

# Call method 'setValue' for contract 'test_contract' and pass arguments
pynear schedule_function_call test_contract setValue --args '{"value":"testtest"}'

# Call view function 'getValue' for contract 'test_contract'
pynear call_view_function test_contract getValue

# Call view function 'benchmark_sum_n' for contract 'test_contract' and pass n=500000
pynear call_view_function test_contract benchmark_sum_n --args='{"n":500000}'

# View state for Bob's account
pynear view_account -a bob.near

# Create an account
pynear create_account cindy 1

# View full state db of the contract
pynear view_state test_contract
```




## Expert: Running a Multi-Node AlphaNet locally

*Note: This is advanced functionality which may be more brittle than usual. It is not necessary in order to simply write contracts. Proceed at your own peril.*

Navigate to the root of the project. To start the network from a new state remove the storage:

    rm -rf test1 test2

We are going to be using test1 and test2 folders for the storage of the corresponding nodes. So make sure both of them have generated keypairs:

    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed alice.near -p test1/storage/keystore/
    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed bob.near -p test2/storage/keystore/

Launch the boot node:

    cargo run --release -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3000 --rpc_port 3030 --base-path=test1 --test-network-key-seed 1 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json -a alice.near -k 4mhK4txd8Z5r71iCZ41UguSHuHFKUeCXPHv646DbQPYi

The boot node will print the string that we can use to boot from it. For example:

    To boot from this node: 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY

Launch the second node using the first one as the boot:

    cargo run --release -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3001 --rpc_port 3031 --base-path=test2 --test-network-key-seed 2 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY -a bob.near -k 22skMptHjFWNyuEWY22ftn2AbLPSYpmYwGJRGwpNHbTV

Submit account creation transaction on one node:

    pynear create_account jason 1 --public-key 22skMptHjFWNyuEWY22ftn2AbLPSYpmYwGJRGwpNHbTV

Verify that the account was created by checking it on the other node:

    pynear view_account -a jason -u http://127.0.0.1:3031/


### Running more nodes locally

This subsection explains how one can run more than two nodes locally. First, start with the clean storage:

    rm -rf test1 test2 test3 test4

Generate the spec file:

    cargo run --package alphanet --bin generate_test_spec -- -n 4 -c node/configs/res/mynet_chain.json

Generate keys for each node:

    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed near.0 -p test1/storage/keystore/
    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed near.1 -p test2/storage/keystore/
    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed near.2 -p test3/storage/keystore/
    cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed near.3 -p test4/storage/keystore/

 In separate terminals run:

    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3000 --rpc_port 3030 --base-path=test1 --test-network-key-seed 1 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/mynet_chain.json -a near.0 -k 82M8LNM7AzJHhHKn6hymVW1jBzSwFukHp1dycVcU7MD
    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3001 --rpc_port 3031 --base-path=test2 --test-network-key-seed 2 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/mynet_chain.json -a near.1 -k CTVkQMjLyr4QzoXrTDVzfCUp95sCJPwLJZ34JTiekxMV --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY
    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3002 --rpc_port 3032 --base-path=test3 --test-network-key-seed 3 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/mynet_chain.json -a near.2 -k EJ1DMa6s2ngC5GtZb3Z2DZzat2xFZ34j15VLY37dcdXX --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY
    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3003 --rpc_port 3033 --base-path=test4 --test-network-key-seed 4 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/mynet_chain.json -a near.3 -k 3DToePHssYc75SsxZgzgVLwXE8XQXKjdpdL7CT7D34UE --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY
