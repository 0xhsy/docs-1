# Quick start

## Build your first application

The easiest way to get started is to skip installing everything on your local machine and just use our fully hosted IDE environment.  To do this:

  1. Go to [NEAR Studio](https://studio.nearprotocol.com) and select the "ToDo MVC" template.
  2. Click "Run" to see the app running!

The app will open in a new window. It's using the blockchain as its backend.

A few things to note:

  + The code that runs on blockchain is in `assembly/main.ts` file.
  + The JavaScript frontend code is in the `src/main.js` file.
  + The UI markup is in `src/main.html file`.

Try changing any of these files. To see your changes, click the "Save" button, and then "Run" button.

## Try the block explorer
Navigate to https://studio.nearprotocol.com/debugger/ in your browser and see the blocks produce in real time!

## Build & Run a node from source

Setup Rust:

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    // You may need to restart the terminal to use the new PATH
    $ rustup component add clippy-preview

You may need to activate the environment via `. ~/.cargo/env` to use `cargo`.

Download NEAR Core code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore
    $ cd nearcore


## Run & interact with DevNet

"DevNet" is a locally hosted single-node "blockchain" that runs WebAssembly and State transition without actually running full blockchain/consensus functionality.  Essentially, you can interact with it as if it was a blockchain for the purposes of writing and testing code.

First, generate a key pair (this saves a key pair into the `keystore` folder to use with `rpc.py`):

```bash
cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed alice.near
```

Then (after following the instructions above to setup Rust) download the source code and then build and run DevNet:

```bash
cargo run --release --package=devnet
```

Use `-- --log-level debug` to see more information about RPC and transaction processing. For more flags use `-- --help`.

Try submitting transactions or views via JSON RPC. There is a Python script that wraps the RPC:

```bash
# Install pynear
cd pynear
# sudo may be required if you are not testing with a python virtual environment
python setup.py develop

# See usage of rpc helper script
pynear --help

# Get usage of sub command
pynear send_money --help

# Send money
pynear send_money -r bob.near -a 1

# Create a new account for the contract
pynear create_account test_contract 1

# Deploy code for the smart contract account
pynear deploy test_contract tests/hello.wasm

# Call method 'setValue' for contract 'test_contract' and pass arguments
pynear schedule_function_call test_contract setValue --args '{"value":"testtest"}'

# Call view function 'getValue' for contract 'test_contract'
pynear call_view_function test_contract getValue

# Call view function 'benchmark_sum_n' for contract 'test_contract' and pass n=500000
pynear call_view_function test_contract benchmark_sum_n --args='{"n":500000}'

# View state for Bob's account
pynear view_account -a bob.near

# Create an account
pynear create_account cindy 1

# View full state db of the contract
pynear view_state test_contract
```

## Running TestNet locally

Navigate to the root of the project. To start the network from a new state remove the storage:

    rm -rf test1 test2

Launch the boot node:

    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3000 --rpc_port 3030 --base-path=test1 --test-network-key-seed 1 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json

The boot node will print the string that we can use to boot from it. For example:

    To boot from this node: 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY
    
Launch the second node using the first one as the boot:

    cargo run -- -a bob.near --addr 127.0.0.1:3001 --rpc_port 3031 --base-path=test2 --test-network-key-seed 2 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY

Submit account creation transaction on one node:

    pynear create_account jason 1 --public-key 22skMptHjFWNyuEWY22ftn2AbLPSYpmYwGJRGwpNHbTV

Verify that the account was created by checking it on the other node:

    pynear view_account -a jason -u http://127.0.0.1:3031/
