# Quick start

There are three options for quick start, depending on what you are trying to build:

  1. **Easy: Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE**
  2. **Medium: Use NEAR with an existing front-end**
  3. **Advanced: Build and run a node from source**


## Easy: Build your first application in the NEAR Studio IDE

<img src ="https://github.com/nearprotocol/NEARStudio/raw/master/demos/guest_book.gif" width="600px"/>

The easiest way to get started is to skip installing everything on your local machine and just use our fully hosted IDE environment. We have a number of pre-built templates which you can use as starter apps.

To do this:

  1. Go to [NEAR Studio](https://studio.nearprotocol.com) and select the "ToDo MVC" template.
  2. Click "Run" to see the app running!

The app will open in a new window. It's using the blockchain as its backend.

A few things to note:

  + The code that runs on blockchain is in `assembly/main.ts` file.
  + The JavaScript frontend code is in the `src/main.js` file.
  + The UI markup is in `src/main.html file`.

Try changing any of these files. To see your changes, click the "Save" button, and then "Run" button.

Useful interactions with Studio:

  + The "Test" button will run the JavaScript tests that are described in the `src/test.js` file.
  + The "Run" button will deploy your front end (the stuff in the `src/` folder) to our hosted service on `app.near.ai/YOUR_UNIQUE_URL/`.  It's sort of like Github Pages.
    + Share the URL with someone else and they will be able to interact with your application. Make sure to remember the trailing `/`
  + The "Fork" button will duplicate the existing code in a new page with a new URL. If you don't want to lose the old URL, copy/paste it somewhere.


## Medium: Use NEAR in an existing app

If you have an app with an existing front-end that you want to hook into the smart contract on the back end, you will need to import our JavaScript SDK on the front-end and write/deploy the smart contract on the back end.

### 1. Import the SDK on your front end

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nearlib@0.2.4/dist/nearlib.js"></script>
```

### 2. Write the smart contract

Write the code!


### 3. Deploy the smart contract


#### Option A: Deploy to your local DevNet

You will need to build and run a local DevNet node. See the following section for how to do this.

Once you have done this, make sure you are within the application's directory and run:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run-script deploy -- --contract guestbook
```

#### Option B: Deploy to our hosted DevNet

Deploy your contract to the same DevNet which the NEAR Studio IDE deploys to.

TODO (this functionality is currently unstable from outside the IDE)


## Try the block explorer / debugger

Once you have tested out the NEAR Studio IDE, check out the Block Explorer (aka Debugger).

Navigate to https://studio.nearprotocol.com/debugger/ in your browser to see information on specific blocks and transactions from those blocks.  This is a useful tool when you are trying to debug your contracts.

Another very useful tool is to open up your console's JavaScript console, where you will be able to print logs and errors.



## Advanced: Build & Run a node from source

You should be able to do anything you want with the above-mentioned NEAR Studio IDE and the Block Explorer.  If you want to keep digging deeper, try running the local DevNet yourself.

"DevNet" is a locally hosted single-node "blockchain" that runs WebAssembly and State transition without actually running full blockchain/consensus functionality.  Essentially, you can interact with it as if it was a multi-node blockchain for the purposes of writing and testing code.

This is exactly what currently runs the DevNet that supports apps deployed using the NEAR Studio IDE (though that particular DevNet is hosted in the cloud by the NEAR team).

In this case, we'll walk through how you can set up your own local DevNet.

*Note that this will be more fragile and prone to weird errors at this stage of the development cycle!  If you're trying to build an app, we recommend staying in NEAR Studio for now!*

This information is adapted from the README in the [nearcore library on Github](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore) but could fall out of date so be sure to check that README for the latest steps.

### 1. Setup Rust:

The core NEAR client is written using the Rust language.

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    // You may need to restart the terminal to use the new PATH
    $ rustup component add clippy-preview

You may need to activate the environment via `. ~/.cargo/env` to use `cargo`.

### 2. Download NEAR Core code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore
    $ cd nearcore


### 3. Set up your keypair

First, generate a cryptographic key pair.  The code below will save a pair of keys into the `keystore` folder to use with `rpc.py`:

```bash
cargo run --package keystore -- keygen --test-seed alice.near
```

### 4. Build DevNet

After following the instructions above to set up Rust and download the source code, it's time to build and then run DevNet:

```bash
cargo run --release --package=devnet
```

Use `-- --log-level debug` to see more information about RPC and transaction processing. For more flags use `-- --help`.

### 5. Test it Out

The node contains a Python-based wrapper which allows you to interact with your node. Use the python commands below to try submitting transactions or views via [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

You will need to have a [package manager from Python (PIP)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed.

Install Protobuf next:

```bash
pip install protobuf
```

Execute the following in the `nearcore` folder to run some Python scripts which will help you test that your DevNet is working properly:

```bash
# See usage of rpc helper script
./scripts/rpc.py --help

# Get usage of sub command
./scripts/rpc.py send_money --help

# Send money
./scripts/rpc.py send_money -r bob.near -a 1

# Create a new account for the contract
./scripts/rpc.py create_account test_contract 1

# Deploy code for the smart contract account
./scripts/rpc.py deploy test_contract tests/hello.wasm

# Call method 'setValue' for contract 'test_contract' and pass arguments
./scripts/rpc.py schedule_function_call test_contract setValue --args '{"value":"testtest"}'

# Call view function 'getValue' for contract 'test_contract'
./scripts/rpc.py call_view_function test_contract getValue

# Call view function 'benchmark_sum_n' for contract 'test_contract' and pass n=500000
./scripts/rpc.py call_view_function test_contract benchmark_sum_n --args='{"n":500000}'

# View state for Bob's account
./scripts/rpc.py view_account -a bob.near

# Create an account
./scripts/rpc.py create_account cindy 1

# View full state db of the contract
./scripts/rpc.py view_state test_contract
```

## Running a Multi-Node "TestNet" locally

*Note: This is advanced functionality which may be more brittle than usual. It is not necessary in order to simply write contracts. Proceed at your own peril.*

Navigate to the root of the project. To start the network from a new state remove the storage:

    rm -rf test1 test2

Launch the boot node:

    cargo run -- --addr 127.0.0.1:3000 --rpc_port 3030 --base-path=test1 --test-network-key-seed 1 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json

The boot node will print the string that we can use to boot from it. For example:

    To boot from this node: 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY

Launch the second node using the first one as the boot:

    cargo run -- -a bob.near --addr 127.0.0.1:3001 --rpc_port 3031 --base-path=test2 --test-network-key-seed 2 --chain-spec-file ./node/configs/res/testnet_chain.json --boot-nodes 127.0.0.1:3000/GuMriipt4yUXfkZL2z3zLPbYaozkZG6zjV6vg4QruEvY

Submit account creation transaction on one node:

    ./scripts/rpc.py create_account jason 1 --public-key 22skMptHjFWNyuEWY22ftn2AbLPSYpmYwGJRGwpNHbTV

Verify that the account was created by checking it on the other node:

    ./scripts/rpc.py view_account -a jason -u http://127.0.0.1:3031/
